      The value R indicates how codes on the left and right side of the table correspond, normally starting from the left-hand column. If R = 1, the two codes are fully equivalent. If R = 2, the ICD-10 code in column A is more detailed than the ICD-9 code in column B, meaning several ICD-10 codes may be needed to match a single ICD-9 code. If R = 3, the situation is reversed: the ICD-10 code is less detailed, and several ICD-9 codes may be required to represent the same content. When R = 4, the relationship is more complex: neither system has unique one-to-one matches, and one code from either side can correspond to several codes on the other side. If R = 5, there is no correspondence at all. In addition, R1 specifies how many codes from ICD-9 are needed to match a code in ICD-10, while R2 specifies how many codes from ICD-10 are required to match a code in ICD-9.
